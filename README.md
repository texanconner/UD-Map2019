# UD-Map2019
I completed this project in 2015 for the front end engineering nanodegree. I used the the same basic solution and code here, but updated it from Yelp API to Wikipedia API calls. Now it lists 5 Dallas Landmarks. All 5 will display initially and listed. You can filter the list and the map markers will be removed per the filter. You can also click on each one for an info window to provide more info, provided by the wikipedia API json data. Clicking on another will close that window and open the next one.  Marker bouncing timeout is 3 seconds.

# How to use
Clone the repository and simply open the index.html in your web browser.

# Resources.
Jquery, Knockous JS, Wikipedia API, Google Maps API

# Error handling
If the API fails, the info window will display a message when clicked. Also there is a console log.
